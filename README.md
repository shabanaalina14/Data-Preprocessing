# Data-Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning. Here’s a brief overview:

- Clean Data: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and detect outliers.

- Transform Data: Normalize or standardize features and encode categorical variables.

- Engineer Features: Select and create relevant features to improve model performance.

- Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

- Integrate Data: Combine data from multiple sources for comprehensive analysis.
